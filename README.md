# 🏥 Medical History Integration System – 3-Week Development Roadmap

**Goal:**  
Developing a local demo of a **role-based medical history management system** with:  
- Role-based login (Doctor and Lab(Hospitals and clinics), Pharmacy, Admin, Patient)  
- Patient medical history  
- Permission code system for patient data access  
- Basic authentication
- Demo presentation at the end of 3 weeks
