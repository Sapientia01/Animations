# 🏥 Medical History Integration System – 3-Week Development Roadmap

**Goal:**  
Develop a local demo of a **role-based medical history management system** with:  
- Role-based login (Doctor, Lab, Pharmacy, Admin, Patient)  
- Patient medical history (CRUD)  
- Permission code system for patient data access  
- Basic authentication (JWT/session)  
- Local demo presentation at the end of 3 weeks

## 👥 Team Structure

- **Frontend Team (2 Devs)**: React + Tailwind (Web Dashboard)  
- **Backend Team (2 Devs)**: Node.js or Django + PostgreSQL (API, Auth, CRUD)  
- **Integration**: Every 2–3 days  
- **Testing**: Every 4 days

- [ ] Implement **Medical History CRUD API**
- [ ] Add **role-based checks for medical history access**
- [ ] Implement **Permission System (Generate + Verify Codes)**
- [ ] Integrate **permission checks before patient data access**
- [ ] Integration & Testing #2
- [ ] Code refactor & cleanup

**Milestone:**  
🎯 Full patient workflow: **Login → Search → Add/View History → Permission Check**
